	\section{Introduction}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Describe the idea of regressing a scalar on functional data
		\item Describing the difference to multiple linear regression intuitively
		\item Giving an intuitive example
	\end{itemize}	
	Functional Data Analysis (FDA) is a relatively new field {\color{red} (roots in the 1940s Grenander and Karhunen)} which is gaining more attention as researchers from different fields collect data that is functional in nature. This data can often be processed by classical statistical methods, but only FDA allows extracting information given by the smoothness of the underlying process (cf. \cite{levitin_introduction_2007}).
	 As \cite{kokoszka_introduction_2017} describe, FDA should be considered when one can view variables or units of a given data set as smooth curves or functions and the interest is in analyzing samples of curves (cf. \cite[S.~17]{kokoszka_introduction_2017}).\\
	 To motivate scalar-on-function regression, consider the case of a data set containing a scalar response and observations of an underlying continuous process. In economics, one application could be the regression of stock market correlations on the Global Crisis Index (GCI), where the regression allows to assess the relationship between the correlation and the GCI at every point within a window (cf. \cite{Das_2019}).\\
	 The focus of this paper is to introduce Functional Linear Regression (FLR) in a scalar-on-function setting. We will be using the standard FLR framework, which relates functional predictors to a scalar response as follows:  {\color{red} (I don't set up any interval for s here we might do later...)}
	 \begin{equation}
	 	Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \int{X_{i}(s)\beta(s)ds} + \epsilon_{i},
	 	\qquad i = 1, ..., n
	 \end{equation}
	 where the $X_{i}$ are realizations of a random function $\mathbf{X}$, $Y_i$ are the corresponding realizations of the response variable and $\beta(s)$ is the coefficient function. The distinct feature of this framework is that the regressor is a function, which necessitates a different approach to estimation. As in the well-known framework of scalar linear regression, this is motivated by an interest in $\beta(s)$ for prediction. For instance, fluctuation in $X_i(s)$ at a point $s_0$ will not have any effect on $Y_i$ if $\beta(s_0)$ = 0. \\
	 Estimation of $\beta(s)$ is inherently an infinite dimensional problem. In Section 2, after introducing the necessary theoretical concepts, we describe three methods of estimating a scalar coefficient function using a concept called truncated basis expansion. The results of the Monte-Carlo simulation regarding these three different methods are reported in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, we test the prediction of FLR in a real world setting. {\color{red} (We may put some simple descriptions of results about each of MC and Application)}

\subsection{Kokoszka Reimherr (2017) p51-53}
There are several important aspects of functional regression in this functional setting that separate it from usual multiple regression according to \cite{kokoszka_introduction_2017}: In functional linear regression, the aim is not only to obtain an estimate of the function $\beta(s)$ because this function also needs to have a useful interpretation. Without it, there might be prediction of the scalar responses from new explanatory functions, but the increase in understanding of the underlying question will be minimal. Thereby, intervals with larger values of $|\beta(s)|$ will contribute more to the response than small values of  $|\beta(s)|$. The sign of $\beta(s)$ indicates either negative or positive influence of $X(s)$ for a specific value of s. To get a useful interpretation, the estimate $\beta$ should not jump in a seemingly random fashion, because a useful interpretation of this erratic behavior will often be impossible and predictions from these model tend to have larger variances and to center around the mean of the responses. (see ~\cite{kokoszka_introduction_2017})
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Explain problem of naively extending multivariate linear regression to infinite dimensions
	\end{itemize}
	Assuming a data generating process of the form:
	\begin{equation}
     Y =  \int \beta(s)X(s) \,dt \ +\epsilon
    \end{equation}
    it becomes clear that we cannot compute the estimate of $\beta(t)$ as we would do in a classical multivariate setup because of the infinite dimensionality of the underlying objects. Define therefore
    \begin{equation}
  	c_{\mathbf{X}}(t,s) = E[\mathbf{X}(t)\mathbf{X}(s)],\: c_{\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}}(t) = E[\mathbf{X}(t)\mathbf{Y}], 
    \end{equation}
   Under the assumption that $X$ is independent from $\epsilon$ we obtain
   \begin{equation}
     c_{\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}}(t) = E[\mathbf{X}(t)\int \beta(t)\mathbf{X}(s) \,ds \ +\epsilon]
   \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
     c_{\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}}(t) = E[\int \beta(s) \: \mathbf{X}(s)\mathbf{X}(t) \, ds \: | \: X]  + E[\epsilon |\mathbf{X}]
  	\end{equation}
   	\begin{equation}
    	c_{\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}}(t) = \int c_{\mathbf{X}}(t,s) \beta(s) \,ds
   \end{equation}
   
   In practice, this results in a large and often difficult to solve system of equations. Even if solved, the result is often a noisy function $\hat{\beta}(s)$ that is not useful for interpretation since it does not use the intuition of smooth functions. Another reason why estimation is not feasible using this approach is colinearity.
   If we approximate the scalar-on-functional regression by assuming a set of discrete observation points for all realizations of the data generating process as
  	\begin{equation}
     Y_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{n} \beta(t_{j})X_i(t_{j}) + \epsilon_{j}
    \end{equation}, it becomes clear that if $t_{j}$ is close to $t_{j'}$, $X_{i}(t_{j})$ is close to $X_{i}(t_{j'})$ there will be vectors $X_{i} = (X_i(t_1), \dots, X_i(t_J))'$ that are highly correlated and thus lead to large variances. {\color{red} isn't something missing here? Like "and employ standard multivariate linear regression"}
