	abstract = {Introduction to Functional Data Analysis provides a concise textbook introduction to the field. It explains how to analyze functional data, both at exploratory and inferential levels. It also provides a systematic and accessible exposition of the methodology and the required mathematical framework.  The book can be used as textbook for a semester-long course on FDA for advanced undergraduate or MS statistics majors, as well as for MS and PhD students in other disciplines, including applied mathematics, environmental science, public health, medical research, geophysical sciences and economics. It can also be used for self-study and as a reference for researchers in those fields who wish to acquire solid understanding of FDA methodology and practical guidance for its implementation. Each chapter contains plentiful examples of relevant R code and theoretical and data analytic problems.  The material of the book can be roughly divided into four parts of approximately equal length: 1) basic concepts and techniques of FDA, 2) functional regression models, 3) sparse and dependent functional data, and 4) introduction to the Hilbert space framework of FDA. The book assumes advanced undergraduate background in calculus, linear algebra, distributional probability theory, foundations of statistical inference, and some familiarity with R programming. Other required statistics background is provided in scalar settings before the related functional concepts are developed. Most chapters end with references to more advanced research for those who wish to gain a more in-depth understanding of a specific topic.},

	abstract = {Theoretical Foundations of Functional Data Analysis, with an Introduction to Linear Operators provides a uniquely broad compendium of the key mathematical concepts and results that are relevant for the theoretical development of functional data analysis (FDA).The self–contained treatment of selected topics of functional analysis and operator theory includes reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, singular value decomposition of compact operators on Hilbert spaces and perturbation theory for both self–adjoint and non self–adjoint operators. The probabilistic foundation for FDA is described from the perspective of random elements in Hilbert spaces as well as from the viewpoint of continuous time stochastic processes. Nonparametric estimation approaches including kernel and regularized smoothing are also introduced. These tools are then used to investigate the properties of estimators for the mean element, covariance operators, principal components, regression function and canonical correlations. A general treatment of canonical correlations in Hilbert spaces naturally leads to FDA formulations of factor analysis, regression, MANOVA and discriminant analysis.This book will provide a valuable reference for statisticians and other researchers interested in developing or understanding the mathematical aspects of FDA. It is also suitable for a graduate level special topics course.},

@book{horvath_inference_2012,
	title = {Inference for {Functional} {Data} with {Applications}},
	isbn = {978-1-4614-3655-3},
	abstract = {This book presents recently developed statistical methods and theory required for the application of the tools of functional data analysis to problems arising in geosciences, finance, economics and biology. It is concerned with inference based on second order statistics, especially those related to the functional principal component analysis. While it covers inference for independent and identically distributed functional data, its distinguishing feature is an in depth coverage of dependent functional data structures, including functional time series and spatially indexed functions. Specific inferential problems studied include two sample inference, change point analysis, tests for dependence in data and model residuals and functional prediction. All procedures are described algorithmically, illustrated on simulated and real data sets, and supported by a complete asymptotic theory. The book can be read at two levels. Readers interested primarily in methodology will find detailed descriptions of the methods and examples of their application. Researchers interested also in mathematical foundations will find carefully developed theory. The organization of the chapters makes it easy for the reader to choose an appropriate focus. The book introduces the requisite, and frequently used, Hilbert space formalism in a systematic manner. This will be useful to graduate or advanced undergraduate students seeking a self-contained introduction to the subject. Advanced researchers will find novel asymptotic arguments.},

	abstract = {Scientists and others today often collect samples of curves and other functional observations. This monograph presents many ideas and techniques for such data. Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors’ own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.

abstract = {Monte Carlo methods are among the most used and useful computational tools available today, providing efficient and practical algorithims to solve a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. Applications covered in this book include optimization, finance, statistical mechanics, birth and death processes, and gambling systems. Explorations in Monte Carlo Methods provides a hands-on approach to learning this subject. Each new idea is carefully motivated by a realistic problem, thus leading from questions to theory via examples and numerical simulations. Programming exercises are integrated throughout the text as the primary vehicle for learning the material. Each chapter ends with a large collection of problems illustrating and directing the material. This book is suitable as a textbook for students of engineering and the sciences, as well as mathematics. The problem-oriented approach makes it ideal for an applied course in basic probability and for a more specialized course in Monte Carlo methods. Topics include probability distributions, counting combinatorial objects, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, option pricing, gamblers ruin, statistical mechanics, sampling, and random number generation.},

	abstract = {There has been substantial recent work on methods for estimating the slope function in linear regression for functional data analysis. However, as in the case of more conventional finite-dimensional regression, much of the practical interest in the slope centers on its application for the purpose of prediction, rather than on its significance in its own right. We show that the problems of slope-function estimation, and of prediction from an estimator of the slope function, have very different characteristics. While the former is intrinsically nonparametric, the latter can be either nonparametric or semiparametric. In particular, the optimal mean-square convergence rate of predictors is n−1, where n denotes sample size, if the predictand is a sufficiently smooth function. In other cases, convergence occurs at a polynomial rate that is strictly slower than n−1. At the boundary between these two regimes, the mean-square convergence rate is less than n−1 by only a logarithmic factor. More generally, the rate of convergence of the predicted value of the mean response in the regression model, given a particular value of the explanatory variable, is determined by a subtle interaction among the smoothness of the predictand, of the slope function in the model, and of the autocovariance function for the distribution of explanatory variables.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate medfly longevity and reproduction across a broad spectrum of diet restriction using a protocol similar to those applied in most rodent studies. Age-specific reproduction and age of death were monitored for 1200 adult males and 1200 females, each individually maintained on one of 12 diets from ad libitum to 30\% of ad libitum. Diet was provided in a fixed volume of solution that was fully consumed each day, ensuring control of total nutrient consumption for every fly. Contrary to expectation and precedence, increased longevity was not observed at any level of diet restriction. Among females, reproduction continued across all diet levels despite the cost in terms of increased mortality. Among males, life expectancy exceeded that of females at most diet levels. However, in both sexes, mortality increased more sharply and the pattern of survival changed abruptly once the diet level fell to 50\% of ad libitum or below, even though the energetic demands of egg production has no obvious counterpart in males. We believe that a more complete picture of the life table response to dietary restriction will emerge when studies are conducted on a wider range of species and include both sexes, more levels of diet, and the opportunity for mating and reproduction.},

@article{Bohacs_Ovadi_Salgo1998,
 abstract = {The test measurements used for the analysis ofgasoline quality are mostly complicated standard procedures which

are time consuming and which require special equipment, large volume of samples and specialists. The standard

test methods could be partly replaced with non-destructive near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic measurements which

are fast and less expensive. The aim of this paper is to present a feasible procedure for the prediction of quality pa-

rameters ofgasoline from its NIR spectrum in a large and very diverse sample set. 350 commercially available gaso-

line samples were collected from July 1996. The samples covered summer and winter grades of normal, super and

superplus unleaded gasolines with minimumRON requirements of 91, 95 and 98, respectively. These fuels covered

a wide range of samples from very different sources including Hungarian and foreign refineries and pumps. An

InfraPrime Lab Analyser (Bran+Luebbe) with high quality optical fibres in combination with multivariate cali-

bration (PLSR) was used to determine 12 different chemical and physical properties ofgasolines including reseach

octane number (RON), motor octane number (MON), benzene, methyl-tertier-buthyl-ether (MTBE), sulphur con-

tent, distillation characteristics, Reid vapour pressure (RVP) and density at 15°C. The developed NIRmethods pre-

dicted four important gasoline properties (RON, MON, benzene and MTBE content) with reproducibilities

equivalent to the standard test procedures. The standard errors of prediction were 0.34 for RON, 0.30 for MON, 0.13{\%}(vv--1) for benzene and 0.21{\%}(vv--1) forMTBE content. The correlation coefficients were better than 0.970 in these calibrations. Calibrations developed for other gasoline properties showed poor correlation coefficients and

allowed each parameter to be predicted only with higher standard error than the reference values. The NIR meth-

ods described are suitable for routine selection measurements in large series of gasoline samples.},
